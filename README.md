## Controls
LEFT and RIGHT arrow to change orientation (A and D also work in _lowercase_)
SPACE BAR to thrust rocket in direction of head?
R to rest position and orientation ( mostly for debugging)

## Debuggin notes
reset button as mentioned before
console prints landers current vector each frame (actually that's supposed to be implemented in the UI)
